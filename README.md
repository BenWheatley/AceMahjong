# AceMahjong

This is just to show what sort of code I wrote back in 2010. Old code is always embarassing (all the stuff you learn since then), and yes I really did leave in a line saying <code>// TODO Auto-generated method stub</code>.

This was written well before <code>goto fail;</code> got in the news; I stopped using one line if statements after that happened, but this code is full of them.

This does not contain the game engine or the assets, so you can't run it in this form. Graphics were handled with JOGL, music was an algorithm that improvised a MIDI file based on a config file, audio was JOAL, payments were handled by Kagi.com who have since shut down (according to Wikipedia).
