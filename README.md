# AceMahjong

This is just to show what sort of code I wrote back in 2010. Old code is always embarassing (all the stuff you learn since then), and yes I really did leave in a line saying <code>// TODO Auto-generated method stub</code>.

This does not contain the game engine or the assets, so you can't run it in this form. Graphics were handled with JOGL, music was an algorithm that improvised a MIDI file based on a config file, audio was JOAL, payments were handled by Kagi.com who have since shut down (according to Wikipedia).
